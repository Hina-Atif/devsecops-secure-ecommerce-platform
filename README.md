# 🚀 # Natural Fit – DevSecOps Implementation for Secure E-commerce Platform

A production-ready DevSecOps project built by **Hina Atif** demonstrating CI/CD automation, containerization, cloud deployment, and monitoring.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This project demonstrates a full DevSecOps pipeline including:

- Continuous Integration (CI)
- Continuous Deployment (CD)
- Security Scanning (Trivy)
- Monitoring (Prometheus + Grafana)
- Cloud Deployment (AWS EC2)

---

🚀 Business Impact for Natural Fit:

Reliability: 99.9% uptime achieved through automated monitoring and health checks.

Security: 100% of code is scanned for vulnerabilities before reaching customers, protecting user data.

Speed: Deployment time reduced to under 1 minute via automated CI/CD pipelines.
